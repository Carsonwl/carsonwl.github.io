Many shows have a beloved cast of characters that have been painstakingly developed, discussed, and discovered by writers and their actors alike. Some of the all-time-greats, like the cast of **FRIENDS**, live on in the pop culture ethos long after the show is gone. Characters like Matthew Perry's Chandler Bing completely define the career of the actor. And, when a show is as popular as **FRIENDS**, it will influence the entire SitCom platform that follows after the show.

**FRIENDS** didn't create the formula for a slice-of-life show centered around a group of attractive friends. Other shows like [Living Single](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_Single) or [Cheers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheers) centered around a group of characters and their romances. Of course, television had long established the "group of friends" trope because it was so relatable to everyone. What made **FRIENDS** different is that it didn't waste time focusing on workplace stories. We often heard about stories surround Monica's restaurant or Joey's auditions, but even in episodes where Joey's acting was a focus, we usually experienced it with the entire group of friends watching Joey on TV together. We were aware that the different characters all had jobs and were working on their careers, but if you were to try to sum the entirity of **FRIENDS** into one sentence, you would say the show is about a group of friends and their romances.

## The Cast and Characters

**How I Met Your Mother** (abbreviated as **HIMYM**) did the same. Clearly inspired by it's spiritual predecessor, the show follows a group of friends that spend most of their days at their favorite bar. More specifically, the show is centered around the main character, Ted Mosby, and his pursuit to find his soulmate. He's a hopeless romantic looking for "the one".

**HIMYM** found major success on network TV with a heralded cast:
- Josh Radnor plays Ted Mosby, the main character, architect, and a hopeless romantic that searches for signs from the universe to show him his one true love.
- Cobie Smulders plays Robin Scherbatsky, aspiring news anchor and journalist that Ted meets at a bar and immediately falls for. She joins the group of friends as the latest addition.
- Jason Segel plays Marshall Eriksen, college friend of Ted and husband to Lily. He's an aspiring lawyer who wants to practice environmental law to save the world's beauty.
- Alison Hannigan plays Lily Aldrin, wife of Marshall and aspiring artist. Lily works as a kindegarten teacher and, more importantly, often comes off as the voice of reason in the group.
- Neil Patrick Harris plays Barney Stinson, self-proclaimed best friend of Ted and mysterious personality. His main driving force is to sleep with women and have a legendary night.

The show excelled at cast and chemistry. In the first season, some of the characters fell flat, in my opinion. Barney Stinson, who would become on of the most popular characters in modern network TV as the show progressed, was a one-dimensional character that took a single personality trait too far. That would quickly change throughout the show, though.
